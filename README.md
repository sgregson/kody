kody
===

_An interactive `.files` and environment configuration CLI tool for OSX, created with node_

_inspired by Zach Holmans popular [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), stripped down and written in node.js_

* One command
* No restrictions on where you run from or store you symlink files.
* Easy to extend and tweak.
* Interactive CLI that prompts which tasks you want to run.
* Just needs `node` and your configuration.

`kody` is essentially a task runner. It comes with one task that will symlink your .files to your `$HOME` directory. Anything else is defined by your own configuration.

## Installation
You'll need to install `node/npm` first as this is a dependency of `kody`.

1. Install `kody`
```shell
npm install -g kody
```
2. Set up your `kody_env`(can be named anything, mine is [here](https://github.com/jh3y/kody_env)!) directory and necessary files (Refer to [usage](#Usage))
3. Run `kody` from within your directory (if you're unsure about anything, backup your original symlinking files to be safe.)
```shell
kody
```
4. Enjoy not having to manually do everything to set up your machine :smile:!


## Usage
In order to use `kody` you'll need to set up a `kody` configuration directory containing a `.kodyrc` file.

Start out with the `dummy_env` directory as a starting point and extend from there if you get stuck. It's what I created my own `kody_env` from and does work.

### Symlinking
`kody` comes with a default task for symlinking files to your `$HOME` directory. The only requirement is that you suffix any files/directories with `.link` in order for those files/directories to be symlinked.

For example; a `kody` configuration directory containing a directory named `atom.link` would be symlinked to `.atom`.

```js
WHEREVER/atom.link -> $HOME/.atom
```

### .kodyrc file
The `.kodyrc` file is used to define variables that will be used by tasks that you define in your configuration. It will also define the order of any defined tasks.

You may also use a `kodyrc.yml` file, with the same API, which can be helpful for including comments in your configuration.

#### An example
```json
{
  "order": [
    "a.js",
    "b.js",
    "*"
  ],
  "brewInstalls": [
    "git",
    "fish"
  ],
  "globalNpmModules": [
    "coffee-script",
    "bower"
  ]
}
```
The `order` key is the only key that is defined by `kody` and required if you need some tasks to run before others. In this example; `a` will run before `b`. A real example would be maybe say making sure `homebrew` would be installed before `brew cask` could be ran.

Any other keys in the `.kodyrc` file are purely user defined and made available in any tasks you write/use. For example; you could use an array with key `globalNpmModules` to define a set of global npm modules to install on your machine.

### Creating tasks
Defining tasks for `kody` to run is what automates your machine setup.
`kody` will automatically pick up any `.js` files within directories that contain `.tasks` in their name. For example; `kody.tasks/`.

A symlinking task is included with `kody`. The rest is your imagination.

The task boilerplate is as follows;

```js
const options = {
  name: 'Task A',
  description: 'A task that does something',
  exec: function(resolve, reject, shell, log, config) {
    // Do some stuff then resolve it.
    resolve();
  }
};

exports.options = options;
```
Tasks are defined by exporting an options object from `.js` files. You define `name`, `description` and `exec`.

* `name {string}` - defines a task name to be used by `kody`.
* `description {string}` - defines a description for a task.
* `exec {function}` - defines a function that will be run by `kody`. The parameters are important. You can name them whatever you want. The `resolve/reject` function must be invoked in order for the task to finish as `kody` relies on `Promises` to run through tasks. `shell` gives you access to the `shelljs` API. `log` gives you access to `kody`'s instance of `winston` logger. Lastly, `config` gives you access to the `.kodyrc` config object.

#### An example task
For an example task, let's install `Homebrew`, the package manager for `OSX`.

```js
const PROPS = {
    URL: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install'
  },
  options = {
    name: 'homebrew',
    description: 'install and set up homebrew',
    exec: function(resolve, reject, shell, log, config) {
      const brewInstalled = shell.which('brew') !== null,
        packages = config.brewInstalls;
      if (!brewInstalled) {
        log.info('installing Homebrew');
        shell.exec(`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL ${PROPS.URL})"`);
        log.success('Homebrew installed');
      } else
        log.warn('Homebrew already installed');
      shell.exec('brew doctor');
      log.warn(`NOTE: any info from brew doctor may
        account for any issues with package installs`);
      if (packages.length > 0) {
        shell.exec(`brew install ${packages.join(' ')}`);
        log.success('brew packages installed');
      }
      resolve();
    }
  };

exports.options = options;
```
#### Tasks that have already been written
* set up git
* write OSX defaults
* Install and set up Homebrew
* Install brew cask and install other programs supported by brew cask such as Spotify, Chrome, etc.
* Set up fish shell
* Install Atom IDE packages
* Remove unwanted default system applications



## Under the hood
`kody` is written using `es6` with `babel` and is developed using `npm run scripts`.

## Disclaimer
I've only used `kody` on OSX(Up to Yosemite, haven't braved Capitan yet) and therefore I can't say for sure how it will run on non-unix based systems etc. `kody` will essentially make symbollic links to the $HOME directory on your PATH and then runs commands from the command line that would normally be executed with bash such as `npm install`.
